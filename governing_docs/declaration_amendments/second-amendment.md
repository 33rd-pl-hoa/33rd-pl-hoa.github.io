Attached to this Second Amendment is an Amended Survey Map and Plans designating the location of the numbered covered and uncovered parking stalls. In addition, on each covered and uncovered parking stall the Declarant has placed a number identifying the parking stall.

All other remaining terms and provisions of this aforesaid Declaration shall remain in full force and effect, except as expressly modified and amended herein. This amendment is made pursuant to paragraph 6.1 of the Condominium Declaration which reserves to the Declarant the right to assign parking stalls. The Declarant hereby reserves the right to assign parking stalls to units which are not assigned as set forth above.
