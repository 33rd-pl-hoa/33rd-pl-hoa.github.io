Three buildings contain twelve (12) Condominium Units each, one building contains four (4) Condominium Units, and one building contains six (6) Condominium Units. Each Unit and the corresponding level of the Building in which said Unit is located is identified more fully in Exhibit "B." The location of the Condominium and the Common Elements is shown on the Survey Map and Plans.

## 4. DESCRIPTION OF UNITS

### 4.1 Basic Units.

Each existing Unit is more fully described in Exhibit "B," including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, built-in fireplaces, square footage, etc., in the Units, should it change. The Declarant reserves the right to amend the change should it change.

### 4.2 Unit Location.

The location of each Unit is as shown on the Survey Map and Plans.

### 4.3 Access to Public Streets.

Each Unit has access to common driveways which have access to the public streets.

### 4.4 Unit Boundaries.

The walls, floors, or ceilings are the boundaries of a Unit, and all lath, furring, wallboard, plasterboard, plaster, paneling, tiles, wallpaper, paint, finished flooring, and any other materials constituting any part of the decorative and finished surfaces thereof, are a part of the Unit. All other portions of the walls, floors, or ceilings are a part of the Common Elements.

If any chute, flue, duct, wire, conduit, bearing wall, bearing column, or other fixture lies partially within and partially outside the designated boundaries of a Unit, any portion thereof serving only that Unit is a Limited Common Element allocated solely to that Unit and any portion thereof serving more than one Unit or any portion of the Common Elements is a part of the Common Elements.

Subject to the above, all spaces, interior partitions, and other fixtures and improvements within the boundaries of a Unit are a part of a Unit.

Furthermore, any shutters, awnings, window boxes, doorsteps, stoops, decks, and all exterior doors, windows or other fixtures designed to serve a single Unit, but which are located outside the Unit's boundaries are Limited Common Elements allocated exclusively to that Unit.

In no event shall a Unit Owner be deemed to own pipes, wires, conduits, the attic crawl space, or other utility lines or commonly used space running through that Owner's Unit which are utilized for, or serve more than one Unit. These shall be part of the Common Elements. (However, crawl spaces, if any, accessing a particular Unit shall be deemed a Limited Common Element of that respective Unit and may be used by the respective Unit Owner at their discretion in a safe manner.)

### 4.5 Monuments as Boundaries.

The physical boundaries of a Unit as originally constructed, or as reconstructed in substantial accordance with the original plans thereto shall be conclusively presumed to be its boundaries rather than the metes and bounds expressed or depicted in the Survey Map and Plans, regardless of settling or lateral movement of the Building and regardless of minor variances between boundaries shown on the Survey Map and Plans and those of the Building.

### 4.6 Procedures for Altering or Subdividing Units.

(a) Subdividing Units. No Unit may be subdivided or the boundaries of a Unit be modified either by agreement or legal proceedings, except as provided in this Section.

  (i) An Owner may propose subdividing a Unit or the Owners of two or more Units may propose amending the legal boundaries between their adjoining Units by submitting a proposal in writing to the Board. As part of the application, the applicant shall prepare an amendment to the Declaration that: identifies the Units involved; assigns numbers to any new Unit; states the changes and reallocations of allocable interest, if any; is executed by those Unit Owners; and, contains words of conveyance between the applicants, if applicable. The applicants are also to have an amendment to the Survey Map and Plans prepared that complies with the Act and which shows the altered boundaries of the Unit(s) and their dimensions and Identifying Numbers. The amendment must be in form reasonably acceptable to the Board.

  (ii) The Board of Directors will have sixty (60) days after receiving the complete application and the proposed amendment to determine whether the subdivision or adjustments to the boundaries are reasonable and whether the proposed changes will materially and adversely affect the functionality of a Common Element. Failure to approve the application within said sixty (60) days will be deemed approval of the application. An application approved by the Board, must then be approved by an affirmative vote of sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Owners and fifty-one percent (51 %) of the Eligible Mortgagees, and all of the Eligible Mortgagees and Owners of the Units to be subdivided or the boundaries of which are to be adjusted.

  (iii) If approved as set forth above, and having received any governmental approvals that are necessary, the President of the Board will sign the documents implementing the amendment, and the applicant will cause the amendment and the amended Survey Map and Plan to be executed by the applicable parties and recorded.

  (iv) Any costs incurred by the Association relating to preparation, review or recording of the amendment shall be the responsibility of the applicants, and the Board may require adequate assurances of payment before approving the application.

(b) Combination of Adjoining Units. After acquiring an adjoining Unit or an interest in part of an adjoining Unit, an Owner may, with the approval of the Board and the Owner and the Eligible Mortgagees of both Units, remove or alter any intervening partition or create apertures therein, even if the partition in whole or in part is a Common Element, if those acts, in the Board's determination, do not adversely affect the structural integrity or acoustical properties of the Building or the plumbing, mechanical, or electrical systems serving another Unit or the Common Elements, or lessen the support of any portion of the Condominium or otherwise adversely affect other Units. Removal of partitions or creation of apertures under this subsection is not a relocation of boundaries and does not change the legal boundaries of the Unit. The Owner's proposal to act under this section is to be submitted to the Board and will include the plans and specifications for the proposed removal or alteration.

(c) Minor Alterations and Hard Surface Flooring. No Unit may be altered in any way except in accordance with this Section. An Owner may make any improvements or alterations to the Owner's Unit that do not adversely affect the structural integrity or acoustical Properties of the

Building, or adversely affect the plumbing, mechanical or electrical systems serving another Unit or the Common Elements, or lessen the support of any portion of the Condominium or otherwise adversely affect other Units. An Owner may not change the flooring in any portion of the Unit that is directly above another Unit from carpeting to hard surface flooring without the prior written approval of the Board. In connection with change from carpet to hard surface flooring, the Board may condition its approval upon installation of acoustical subflooring material and/or coverage of certain areas with carpet. An Owner may not change the appearance of the Common Elements or the exterior appearance of a Unit without the prior approval of the Board.

(d) Substantial Alterations. Except as provided herein, a proposal that would involve a substantial alteration of a Unit is subject to approval of the Board. The Board may retain, at the Owner's expense, an architect or engineer to review the plans and require evidence that all permits necessary for the work have been obtained or will be obtained. The Board shall approve an Owner's request under this section within sixty (60) days of receipt of the proposal, along with plans and specifications and an opinion of a qualified architect or engineer that the alteration will not adversely affect the structural integrity or acoustical properties of -che Building, or adversely affect the plumbing, mechanical or electrical systems serving another Unit or the Common Elements, or lessen the support of any portion of the Condominium or otherwise adversely affect other Units. The failure of the Board to act upon such a request within such period will be deemed approval thereof.

(e) Procedure After Approval. Upon approval of the proposed change under this Article, the Owner may proceed according to the proposed plans and specifications, provided that the Board may require that, before any work begins, the work be subject to the Board's review, adequate provision be made for payment of the work free and clear of liens, there are adequate protections in place against excessive noise and disruptions to other Owners and for the safety of the other Owners and the Common Elements, and that reasonable deadlines for completion of the work are established.

(f) Application to Declarant. The provisions of this Article will not apply to Declarant if exercising a Development right reserved in this Declaration.

## 5. DESCRIPTION OF COMMON ELEMENTS

The Common Elements consist of all portions of the Condominium except the Units, and including the following:

In addition to any Limited Common Elements provided by law or other provisions of this Declaration, the Limited Common Elements consist of the following:

(a) Mailboxes. Each Unit has, as a Limited Common Element, an assigned mailbox or mailbox area located at the discretion of the U.S. Postal Service. Designation of the mailboxes shall be made at the time of the initial sale of a Unit.

Each Unit to which a parking space is assigned will have exclusive use of that parking space.

The Declarant reserves the right to assign to Units additional parking space(s) as a Limited Common Element and that assignment will be completed by a designation on said parking space as to the Unit to which it is assigned and it will not be necessary to amend either the Survey Map and Plans or the Declaration in order to assign an additional parking space to a Unit as a Limited Common Element.

(c) Decks/Patios. If a Unit Owner has a deck or patio adjoining their Unit, the deck or patio is a Limited Common Element of that Unit.

(d) Fireplaces . If the Unit Owner has a built-in fireplace, then that fireplace is a Limited Common Element of that Unit.

### 6.2 Transfer of Limited Common Elements.

(a) Reallocation Between Unit. Except for a reallocation by the Declarant pursuant to a Development right reserved in this Declaration, a Limited Common Element may only be reallocated between Units with the approval of the Board and by an amendment to this Declaration executed by the Owners and approved in writing by the Mortgagees holding Mortgages against the Units to which the Limited Common Element was and will be allocated. The Board will not unreasonably withhold its approval but, as to parking spaces and mail boxes, it will require that at least one parking space and one mail box be assigned to each Unit. Any costs incurred by the Association relating to preparation, review and recording of the amendment and, if necessary, the Survey Map and Plans, shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

(b) Common Element to Limited Common Element. Except as provided above and pursuant to the Development rights reserved to the Declarant in this Declaration, Owners of Units to which at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the votes are allocated, including one hundred percent (100%) of the Owner of the Unit to which the Common Element will be assigned, must agree to reallocate a Common Element as a Limited Common Element. Any reallocation or incorporation shall be reflected in an amendment of this Declaration and, if necessary, the Survey Map and Plans. This section shall not apply to the Declarant if exercising a Development right reserved in this Declaration.

Except as provided above, Owners of Units to which at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the votes are allocated, including one hundred percent (100%) of the Owners of the Unit to which the Common Element will be assigned, must agree to incorporate a Common Element or Limited Common Element into an existing Unit. Any reallocation or incorporation shall be reflected in an amendment of this Declaration and, if necessary, the Survey Map and Plans.

## 7. ALLOCATED INTEREST IN COMMON ELEMENTS, COMMON EXPENSES, AND VOTING RIGHTS

### 7.1 Percentages: Ownership and Common Expenses.

The formula for determining each Unit Owner's undivided ownership interest in the Common Elements and each Unit Owner's Common Expense Liability shall be determined by dividing into 100 the total number of Units so that each Unit shall have a 1146th interest in the Common Elements and share of the Common Expense Liability.

### 7.2 Voting Rights.

For purposes of membership voting on any Association matter, each Unit shall have one vote regardless of percentages of ownership or values. No votes allocated to a Unit owned by the Association may be cast, and in determining the percentage of votes required to act on any matter, the votes allocated to Units owned by the Association shall be disregarded.

### 7.3 Restrictions on Reallocation.

The allocated interest appertaining to each Unit cannot be changed except as set forth in this Declaration. The allocated interest and the title to the respective Units shall not be separated or separately conveyed and each undivided interest shall be deemed to be conveyed with its respective Unit even though the description in the instrument of conveyance or encumbrance may refer only to the title to the Unit. Except where permitted by the Act, the Common Elements are not subject to partition; and, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an allocated interest made without the Unit to which that interest is allocated is void.

Until the Transition Date, the Declarant may veto or approve a proposed action of the Board or the Association, provided such action is taken in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the proposed action.

The Declarant may not remove any member of the Board of Directors elected by the Unit Owners, even if that Director was elected during the Declatant's period of control.

### 8.8 Standard of Care.

If a Director is appointed by the Declarant, the care required of that Director shall be the care of a fiduciary to the Unit Owners; if a Director is elected by the Unit Owners, then the duty of care required shall be ordinary and reasonable care. However, if the statutory standard of care is, at any time, different than the standard of care set forth in this Declaration this Declaration shall be deemed amended so that the standard of care shall be that standard set forth statutorily for condominiums in the State of Washington. This subsection shall not apply where the consequences of such act, omission, error, or negligence are covered by the insurance obtained by the Board.

### 8.15 Legal Proceeding.

The term Legal Proceedings as used herein shall include litigation, administrative, mediation, arbitration or other proceedings in the name of the Association on behalf of itself or two or more unit owners on matters affecting the condominium.

The provisions of the Section shall not apply to Legal Proceedings, as a result of which the Association could not be held responsible for costs of suit (including fees for attorneys, experts, witnesses, investigations and other costs of suit) in an aggregate amount of not more than $5,000, and which involve: (a) collection of delinquent regular or special Assessments, the enforcement of any Assessment lien, and interest and penalties in connection therewith; (b) collection of monies owed to the Association, or recovery of damages caused to the Association or Condominium (or any part thereof), when the principal amount to be recovered involves less than $25,000; (c) enforcement of the provisions of the Declaration, Articles, Bylaws or rules and regulations of the Association; or (d) defense of a claim against the Association, when the principal amount to be recovered involves less than $25,000.

## 9. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF PROPERTY

### 9.1 Residential Use; Rules.

The primary use of the Building and the Units described in this are intended for Residential Purposes only, and their use is so restricted. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Association may, from time to time, by a vote of a majority of its members, make, alter, or repeal Rules ·and Regulations covering details of the operation and use of the Property, reserving to the Unit Owners the right to change or repeal such Rules and Regulations on the approval of fifty-one percent (5 1 %) of the Total Voting Power of the Association. No such Rule or Regulation shall change the requirement that the Units and Property be used only for Residential Purposes. Furthermore, no Unit shall be used principally for agricultural or farming purposes under any circumstances.

### 9.2 Use by Declarant.

The Declarant may maintain a sales office, management office, and model(s) within a Unit or on Common Elements in the Condominium until such time as its right to select Directors terminates pursuant to subsection 8.4. During this time, Declarant may maintain signs on the Common Elements advertising the Condominium.

### 9.3 Leases.

The leasing or renting of a Unit by its Owner, with the exception of the Declarant, shall be governed by the provisions of this subsection.

(a)  No Transit Purposes. With the exception of an Institutional Holder in possession of a Unit following a default in a first Mortgage, a foreclosure proceeding, or any deed or other arrangement in lieu of foreclosure, Unit Owners are prohibited from leasing their Unit(s) for less than thirty (30) days.

(b) Entire Unit . No Unit Owner may lease or rent less than the entire Unit.

(c) Written Leases. All leases and rental agreements of Units shall be in writing and the tenant shall be subject to all of the provisions of the Association Management Documents. A copy of any lease shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Association within seventy-two (72) hours of a lease being signed. An Owner leasing a Unit must provide any tenant of that Owner's Unit a copy of the Declaration, Articles of lncorporation, Bylaws, and Rules and Regulations, if any, prior to the tenant signing the lease. Any failure by tenant to comply with the terms of the Association Management Documents shall be a default under the lease. Any such lease shall provide that in the event that the Unit is sold by the Unit Owner, the lease shall terminate on the sale, and that the lease shall terminate upon foreclosure of a Unit by a Mortgagee constituting a first lien on such Unit. If any tenant violates or permits his/her guests to violate any of the Association Management Documents after notice of such violation has been given on two or more occasions, the Board may, at the expense of the Unit Owner, give notice of termination to the tenant or occupant of the Unit and the Owner thereof and have the authority to evict the tenant or occupant if the Owner fails to do so after notice from the Board. The Board shall have no liability for a good faith eviction. The Board may have a lien against a Unit Owner's Unit for the costs associated with the eviction, including costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees and such may be collected in the same manner as Assessments are collected and foreclosed in Section 11.

(d) Parking Space Leases. A Unit Owner may lease its assigned parking space, but only if the assignee is a Unit Owner within the Condominium, and if the Association has been given notice of such a leasing arrangement. Further, the lease may be terminated upon 15 days notice, and will be automatically terminated upon the transfer of title of the Unit to which the parking space being rented is assigned as a Limited Common Element.

(e) Commercial Use Prohibited. No Unit Owner shall be permitted to rent or lease that Owner's Unit for commercial purposes.

(f) Rent to Association. If a Unit is rented by its Owner, the Board may collect, and the tenant shall pay over to the Board, so much of the rent for such Unit as is required to pay any amounts due the Association hereunder, plus interest and costs if the same are in default over thirty (30) days. Such payment will discharge the tenant's duty of payment to the Owner for rent, to the extent such rent is paid to the Association, but will not discharge the liability of the Owner or Purchaser and the Unit under this Declaration for Assessments and charges, or operate as an approval of the lease. The Board shall not exercise this power where a receiver has been appointed with respect to the Unit or its Owner; nor in derogation of any rights that a Mortgagee of such Unit may have with respect to such rents. Other than as stated in this section, there is no restriction on the right of any Unit Owner to lease or rent his or her Unit.

### 9.4 Signs.

Other than signs posted by the Declarant in connection with the development and sale of the Condominium, all signs shall be subject to regulation by the Board of Directors.

### 9.5 Vehicle Parking Restrictions.

Common Element and Limited Common Element parking spaces are restricted to use for parking of operable passenger motor vehicles such as automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans; other items and equipment may be parked or kept there only subject to the provisions of the Rules and Regulations. The Board may require removal of any vehicle (and any other personal property) improperly stored in parking spaces or any inoperative or unsightly vehicle. If the same is not removed, the Board shall cause removal at the risk and expense of the Owner. Residents' vehicles are expected to be parked within the space assigned to their Unit. Any parking spaces which are not assigned to a Unit as a Limited Common Element, either in this Declaration or subsequently by the Declarant as set forth in paragraph 6.1(b) above, then said unassigned parking spaces shall be for the exclusive use of owners or owners' guests and invitees on a first come basis. The Association shall have the right to adopt parking rules and regulations concerning the use of said m1assigned parking spaces, including restrictions as to use by unit owners and/or their guests and invitees.

### 9.6 Garbage and Refuse.

All garbage and other waste shall be discarded only in appropriate sanitary containers in designated garbage pick-up areas within the Common Elements. Disposal of waste, yard takings such as rocks, lawn and shrubbery clippings, garbage, dirt or other materials onto any Common Element shall be subject to fines established by the Board of Directors, plus all costs associated with removal and proper disposal by the Association and payable to the Association.

### 9.7 Nuisances.

No noxious, offensive, or undesirable thing, use, or activity shall be permitted or maintained within any Unit, or on any portion of the Property, including, but not limited to, odor, noise, vibration, or any machine or other installation that interferes with the safety, comfort, or health of any Unit Owner. If the Board determines that a thing or use is undesirable or noxious, that determination shall be conclusive. Likewise, all Unit Owners shall be considerate of all other Unit Owners and shall limit noise from emanating outside of their respective Unit within the hearing range of another Unit.

### 9.8 Antennas and Dishes.

No dish or other type of exterior antenna or receiver larger than one meter in diameter shall be allowed on any Unit Limited Common Element, Common Elements, or any other part of the Condominium unless approved by the Board. The use, installation and maintenance of antennas and dishes one meter or less in diameter shall be allowed, provided that the Board determines that: (a) its location is confined to a Unit Owner's Limited Common Elements; (b) it is not placed on any deck railing; and, (c) it cannot easily be seen from another Owner's Unit, Limited Common Elements, or from the exterior of the Building. The Association reserves the right to require that the antenna or dish be painted, screened or relocated should the Board determine that it is unsightly or obtrusive to the overall aesthetics of the Condominium. This provision shall be limited as provided by applicable law.

### 9.9 Pets.

No animals, livestock, or poultry of any kind, other than household pets, shall be kept, bred or maintained on any part of the Property. Unless otherwise approved by the Board, no more than two (2) household puts shall be permitted in the Unit. Unless otherwise approved by the Board, the maximum combined weight limit of such household pets shall not exceed forty (40) pounds and, in any case, such pets must not be kept, bred or maintained for any commercial use or purpose. For the purposes of this provision, "household pets" shall be limited to dogs, cats, and birds. No reptiles or members of the rodent species (i.e., gerbils, hamsters, mice, rats) shall be kept on any part of the Property. If a Unit Owner keeps, breeds, or maintains a dog, the Unit Owner must control the dog in such a way so as to minimize excessive noise from barking, and keep it on a leash at all times under the Unit Owner's control when outside of a Unit, or the dog shall be considered a nuisance and not permitted to remain on the Property. All Owners shall promptly remove and dispose of all animal waste and the Board may impose fines for failure to do so.

### 9.10 Business and Commercial Use of  Property.

No trade, craft, business, or manufacturing enterprise, or business or commercial activity of any kind shall be conducted or carried out in any Unit, or within the Property itself, unless the following conditions are met: (1) the Unit associated with the business or commercial use must serve as the primary residence for that Unit's Owner; (2) the existence or operation of the business is not apparent or detectable by sight, sound, or smell from outside the Unit; (3) the business activity does not involve regular visitation of the Unit by clients, customers, suppliers, or other business invitees or door-to-door solicitation of Unit Owners; and, (4) no goods, equipment, vehicles, and/or materials or supplies used in connection with any trade, service, or business shall be kept, parked, or stored outside of a Unit, for more than six (6) hours without being removed.

### 9.11 Alterations of Units.

An Owner may, at that Owner's sole cost and expense, make any improvements or alterations to the Owner's Unit that the Owner deems necessary or appropriate for the proper maintenance of that Owner's Unit. Any other improvements or alterations may be made subject to the provisions of subsection 9 .12.

### 9.12 Alterations of Common and Limited Common Elements.

An Owner may not change the appearance of any Common Element without permission of the Association. Any such change would require approval of the Board or a delegated subcommittee of the Board. The appearance of a Limited Common Element may not be changed without permission of the Board or a delegated subcommittee of the Board. However, Owners may tastefully decorate their deck with planters and furniture without approval from the Association but this does not include hot tubs or other items of equipment. The Board, at its discretion, may require the removal or alteration of any decoration which it reasonably determines to be obtrusive, out of character with the general setting and scheme of the Condominium, inappropriate because its use may contribute to cross noise or otherwise offend other units owners, or present risks to the safety of the Building or its occupants.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to Units owned by the Declarant until those Units have been sold by the Declarant.

### 9.13 Timeshares.

Time-sharing is prohibited.

### 9.14 Noise Control.

All Unit Owners and their tenants, guests, and other invitees, licensees, or guests, shall be required to minimize the transmission of noise from their Unit to other Unit Owners' hearing range within the Condominium. At a minimum, Unit Owners shall be required to limit noise generated from general household activity, movement, conversations, altercations, children's activity, music, radios, computers, games, televisions, household appliances, and other means of sound transmission so that it cannot be heard outside of the Owner's Unit by other Unit Owners, or so that it is not offensive and does not create a nuisance to other Unit Owners in the Condominium. Unit Owners shall take any and all necessary and precautionary steps to avoid sound transmission from their Unit to any other Unit adjoining or nearby. Replacement of any appliances or devices must be at least as sound insulated as the prior appliance or device.

(b) Assessments to pay a judgment against the Association may be made only against the Units in the Condominium at the time the judgment was entered in proportion to their allocated Common expense liabilities at the time the judgment was entered; and

However, Declarant shall be reimbursed when the sale of a Unit closes for which Declarant had previously paid into the working capital fund. Amounts paid into this fund should not be considered as advanced payments of regular Assessments.

### 11.8 Commencement of Assessments.

The Declarant hereby grants to Chicago Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company"), as Trustee, all Units in the Condominium and all Property of which the Condominium is a part. This grant is for the sole purpose of securing the obligations of the Unit owners to the Association for the payment of Assessments. Said Title Company shall act as Trustee for the benefit of the Association, as beneficiary. On default by any Unit Owner in the payment of any Assessments, and on the written request of the beneficiary, Trustee shall sell the trust property in accordance with the Deed of Trust Act of the State of Washington, at a public auction to the highest bidder. Any person, including the Association or its authorized representative, shall have the power to purchase the Unit at the foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the same, except that the Trustee may not bid at the Trustees sale. The proceeds of the sale shall be applied as follows: (1) to the expense of the sale, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs; (2) to the obligation owed by the defaulting Unit Owner; and, (3) the surplus, if any, shall be distributed to the beneficiary to be added to the general Assessments fund of the Association. On an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption shall be eight (8) months. For purposes of foreclosure, it is hereby declared that the Units and the appurtenant Common Elements are not used principally for agricultural purposes; Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure. This power of sale is not an exclusive remedy; the Association may pursue any other remedy available under the terms of this Declaration or at law.

### 12.9 Receivers.

From the time of commencement of an action by the Association to foreclose a lien for nonpayment of delinquent Assessments against a Unit that is not occupied by the Owner of the Unit; the Association shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect from the tenant the rent for the Unit as and when due. If the rental is not paid, the receiver may obtain possession of the Unit; refurbish it for rental up to a reasonable standard for rental units in this type of condominium; rent the Unit or permit its rental to others; and, apply the rents first to the cost of the receivership and attorneys' fees thereof, then to the cost of refurbishing the Unit, then to applicable charges, then to costs, fees, and charges of the foreclosure action, and then to the payment of the delinquent Assessments. Only a receiver may take possession and collect rents under this subsection, and a receiver shall not be appointed less than ninety (90) days after the delinquency. The exercise by the Association of the foregoing rights shall not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the Unit.

### 12.10 Remedies Cumulative.

The remedies provided are cumulative, and the Board may pursue them concurrently, as well as any other remedies that may be available under law although not expressed herein.

## 13. INSURANCE

### 13.1 General Requirement for Property Insurance.

Commencing not later than the time of the first written conveyance of a Unit to a person other than the Declarant, the Board of Directors shall be required to obtain and maintain, paying the premiums as a Common expense:

(a) a "master" or "blanket" type of property insurance policy on the Condominium, which may, but need not include equipment, improvements, and betterments in a Unit installed by the Declarant or the Unit Owners, insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against. The insurance shall include earthquake insurance if a majority of the Board of Directors approves such coverage, and if such coverage is available at a reasonable cost. All property covered by the policy shall be insured in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of current replacement cost at the time the policy is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies. The blanket policy shall contain a standard mortgagee clause in favor of each mortgagee of a Unit, which clause shall provide that the loss, if any, thereunder shall be payable to such mortgagee as its interest may appear, subject, however, to the loss payments provisions in favor of the Association.

(b) comprehensive general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance covering all the Common Elements. Such insurance shall be not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for each single accident or occurrence arising out of in connection with use, ownership, or maintenance of the Common Elements and shall cover bodily injury, deaths of persons, and property damage, including water damage. The liability insurance policy shall cover each member of the Board of Directors, and each Unit Owner, with cross-liability endorsement to cover liabilities of the Unit Owners as a group to a Unit Owner. The amount of coverage can be increased at the discretion of the Board.

(c) blanket fidelity insurance in an amount determined by the Board, for all officers, directors, trustees, management agents,' employees of the Association, and all other persons handling or responsible for funds of or administered by the Association.

(d) workman's compensation insurance, to the extent required by applicable law.

(e) insurance against loss of personal property of the Association by fire, theft and other losses with deductible provisions as the Board deems advisable.

(f) such other insurance (including directors and officers liability) as the Board deems advisable; provided, that notwithstanding any other provisions, the Association shall continuously maintain in effect such casualty, flood and liability insurance and a fidelity bond meeting the insurance and fidelity bond requirements for condominium projects established by Federal National Mortgage Association, Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies involved in the secondary mortgage market, so long as any such agency is a Mortgagee or Owner of a Unit with the Condominium, except to the extent such coverage is not available or has been waived in writing by such agency.

### 13.2 Required Provisions.

The insurance policies carried pursuant to this Article shall provide that:

(a) each Unit Owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the Owner's interest in the Common Elements or membership in the Association;

(b) the insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any Unit Owner, member of the Owner's household, or tenant of the Owner;

(c) no act or omission by any Unit Owner, unless acting within the scope of the Owner's authority on behalf of the Association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy;and

(d) it at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a Unit Owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the Association's policy provides primary insurance.

### 13.3 Adjustment of Loss.

Any loss covered by the property insurance under subsection 13.1 of this Section must be adjusted with the Association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the Association, and not to any holder of a Mortgage. The insurance trustee or the Association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for Unit Owners and lienholders, as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of Section 14, the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the purpose of promptly repairing or rebuilding the damaged or destroyed property, and Unit Owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the Condominium is terminated.

### 13.4 Insurance Is Unavailable.

If the insurance described in this insurance section is not reasonably available, the Association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand-delivered or sent prepaid by first class United States mail to all Unit Owners, to each Eligible Mortgagee, and to each Mortgagee to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses.

### 13.5 Insurance by Unit Owners.

An insurance policy issued to the Association does not prevent a Unit Owner from obtaining insurance for the Owner's own benefit. All Unit Owners shall carry additional insurance for their own benefit insuring their Unit, including carpeting, wall coverings, fixtures, furniture, furnishings, and other personal property. All such policies shall contain waivers of subrogation and the liability of the carriers issuing insurance obtained by the Board of Directors shall not be affected or diminished by reason of any such additional insurance carried by any Unit Owner.

### 13.6 Certificate of Insurance.

An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this Article shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the Association and, upon written request, to any Unit Owner or holder of a Mortgage. The insurer issuing the policy may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy unless the insurer has complied with all applicable provisions of Ch. 48.18 RCW pertaining to the cancellation or nonrenewal of contracts of insurance. The insurer shall not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy, or cancel or refuse to renew the policy without complying with this Section.

### 13.7 Notification on Sale of Unit.

If sufficient the proceeds shall be applied to repair, reconstruct, or rebuild the Property in accordance with the original plans.

Furthermore, should a decision be made to not repair, reconstruct, or rebuild the Property, or should there be additional insurance funds available, the Association shall determine the allocation of those insurance funds.

(a) the nature and extent of the damage or destruction, together with an inventory of the improvements and property affected;

(b) a reasonably reliable estimate of the cost to repair the damage, which estimate shall, if reasonably practicable, be based upon a firm bid obtained from a responsible contractor;

(c) the anticipated insurance proceeds, if any, to be available from insurance covering the loss based on the amount paid or initially offered by the insurer;

(d) the amount, if any, that the estimated cost of repair exceeds the anticipated insurance proceeds and the amount of Assessment to each Unit if such excess was paid as a Common expense and specially assessed against all Units in proportion to their allocated interest in the Common Elements; and

(c) the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the Unit Owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the Common Element interests of all the Units.

### 14.7 Emergency Work.

The Board shall need no approval from the Association or a Unit Owner for emergency work. "Emergency work" shall mean that work, which the Board determines, is reasonably necessary to avoid further damage, destruction, or substantial diminution in value to improvements and to reasonably protect the Owners from liability resulting from the condition of the Property.

(a) for payment to Unit Owners and their Mortgagees eliminated in the revised documents, to the extent the value of the entire Unit was an element of the condemnation award;

(b) toward restoration of the remaining Common Element;

(c) for payment to Unit Owners and their Mortgagees specially damaged by the condemnation, but which remain in the Condominium, which damages were an element of the condemnation award; and

On the basis of the foregoing principal, the Board of Directors shall, as soon as practicable, determine the share of the condemnation award to which each Owner is entitled.
